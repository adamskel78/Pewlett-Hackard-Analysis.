## Challenge
 	 This challenge involved a company that was dealing with what all companies will deal with. Every company has to deal with the fact that a number of their employees are preparing to retire. If a company doesn’t have a strategy to deal with these departure, it opens itself up for trouble down the road. We were tasked with finding out how many people are eligible to retire. The company also wanted to know what their titles were as well. The other task was to make a list of people that would be eligible for a mentorship program to help slow the impact of the departing employees.
	 
	Some of the problems that I ran into on this challenge was trying to go through the steps that the course wants us to go through in order to get the correct answers. It was never made clear that every employee is a current one or not. This database did have multiple entrees for the same employee if they switched titles or transferred departments. This created a problem in our data that we had to remove peoples duplicate entrees in our data. We used a partition to gather the most recent title of the employees. This cleaned up our data so we only had the employees most recent title on record so our boss would know which title that will need to be replaces. 
	
	We found out that 90,398 employees are eligible to retire. The set of criteria we were given to assess retirement eligibility was being born from 1952 to 1955. I think more work can be done on this number to get a more accurate assessment. I think we need to go back and make sure all these people are current employees. My guess is that some of these people are not still working at the company. I would put a condition on the original data to make sure they are current employees. I did that same with the list for the mentorship program and it only came back with current employees that would be ready to start a mentorship program. I didn’t do the same for the retirement info because I would have skipped a step in the instructions that I wouldn’t have had to figure out how to work the partition function.
